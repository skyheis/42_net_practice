# 42 net practice

This project is a collection of exercises to practice network concepts.
In my sysadmin background, I had the opportunity to study and practice a lot of network concepts. But it was a great way to refresh my knowledge and learn new things. I wouldn't take it as real practice, but more as a way to learn and understand how things work.

## How to use it

You can simply open the index.html file in your browser and navigate through the different exercises. If you don't insert a username, you'll open the "exam-mode". In this mode, you will have to resolve 3 random exercises from level 6 to level 10. In order to pass the evaluation, you have to complete them in less than 15 minutes.
